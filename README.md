### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Flavius!

---

I am a Software Developer. I mainly code in <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" width="15" height="15"/>Python and <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/go/go-original.svg" width="15" height="15"/>Golang with the aspiration of also learning <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/rust/rust-plain.svg" width="15" height="15"/>Rust.

During my spare time, I like to contribute to open source software, like the [LXD](https://github.com/lxc/lxd) project, which in turns allows me to further develop my software engineering skills.

I am currently learning <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/kubernetes/kubernetes-plain.svg" width="15" height="15"/>Kubernetes with the aim of getting the `Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)` accreditation from the [Linux Fundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

###### P.S. Big shoutout to [@catalinpit](https://github.com/catalinpit). His content inspired this intro.
